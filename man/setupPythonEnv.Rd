\arguments{
\item{venv_name}{Character. Name of the virtual environment to create.
Defaults to "pyShinyCell". The environment will be created in
`~/.virtualenvs/<venv_name>`.}

\item{python_exe}{Character. Path to Python executable or version specification.
Defaults to `Sys.which("python3")`.}

\item{packages}{Character vector. Python packages to install. Defaults to:
c("numpy", "pandas", "h5py", "pyreadr", "tables", "scanpy", "anndata",
  "scipy", "gseapy", "enrichr")}

\item{force}{Logical. If TRUE, removes and recreates the environment even if
it already exists. Defaults to FALSE.}

\item{verbose}{Logical. If TRUE, prints status messages during setup.
Defaults to TRUE.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns the path to the virtual environment.

\description{
Creates and configures a Python virtual environment with required packages
for pyShinyCell analysis. This function is typically called once during initial
package setup. It can be safely called multiple times as it checks for existing
environments before creating new ones.
}
\details{
This function performs the following steps:
1. Clears existing Python environment variables to avoid interference
2. Creates a Python virtual environment if it doesn't exist
3. Upgrades pip, setuptools, and wheel
4. Installs required Python packages
5. Activates the environment in reticulate
6. Verifies all packages can be imported

The function is idempotent: running it multiple times on the same environment
is safe and will skip re-creation if the environment already exists.
}
\section{Dependencies}{

Requires the `reticulate` package to be loaded.

# This is typically called internally or requires setup.
